## Requirements:
### Core Features:

1. **Current Weather:** Display the current weather for a specified location.
2. **3-Day Forecast & 3-Day History:** Show weather details for the next 3 days and the past 3 days in a grid or list view.
3. **Interactive Selection:** Clicking on a day’s weather tile updates the main display to show details for that specific day.

### Bonus Points
 - Animations or transitions for a better user experience.
 - Responsive design for mobile and desktop screens.
 - Innovative use of browser storage or service workers for caching.
 - Well-structured commit history.

## Guidelines:
 - Use React with TypeScript.
 - Use Vite to scaffold your app (or an equivalent setup you’re comfortable with).
 - Fetch data using the WeatherStack API (free tier). Use the native Fetch API (no libraries like Axios).
 - Choose any styling approach you prefer (e.g., CSS-in-JS, Tailwind, Chakra UI, etc.).

## Deliverables:
- **Functioning Weather App:** The core features must work as described.
- **Documentation:**
  - Clear instructions on how to set up and run the app.
  - Brief explanation of design decisions and trade-offs.
- **Tests:** Include tests that validate core features

## Submission:
Upload your project to a public GitHub repository and share the link.
